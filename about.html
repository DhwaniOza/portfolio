                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Hi, I am Dhwani Oza, a content generator and social media specialist with a love for writing and a tangible idea in my head what the content should look like. I consider myself an expert in creating relevant and effective content and concepts that will allow for businesses and individuals to develop and communicate with one another positively online.<br><br>

I started my professional career with performing arts and there I nurtured myself with art of telling and showing stories. Such professional background coupled with my filmmaking and other digital content creation skills has helped me in realizing some creative concepts. Throughout the years, I have functions and executed campaigns, that required me to learn and manage social media campaigns, video promotions and editing, graphic designing and even analyzing of the results, where art merged with measurement to create more results.<br><br>

I’ve had the opportunity of working on a wide range of projects ranging from managing social media campaign that saw high activity, to executive producing creative videos and short films. These positions have not only provided me with the needed technical understanding of the matters being solved but also with the opportunity to learning lessons on teamwork, timely management of tasks, and being ahead of time especially given today’s fast developing digital world.<br><br>

At the present time, I am working on a Postgraduate Diploma in Digital Content Creation and Strategy at Georgian College as a basis of my courses in Advanced Filmmaking and Digital Marketing. It is still providing me with the means for improving upon my education and broadening my scope for successful implementation of further solutions related to content production and brand development.<br><br>

Apart from work, my hobbies are to keep up with the tags, try out artsy new applications, and come up with strategies to solve certain marketing problems. My primary objective is to keep on positioning this as a platform that informs stories, captivates the viewers and delivers on the goals set by the brands.<br><br>

Learn about my experience with social influence, check out the projects I done and the changes that I initiated. I have to work together for a product that is extraordinary and stands out among the rest!</p>
